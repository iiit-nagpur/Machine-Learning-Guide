## Welcome  
> Welcome and congratulations on your decision to learn ML.
But *What is Machine Learning*?
In recent times machine learning is one of the buzz world and is often used interchangebly with Artificial intelligence and Data Science, so lets esablish the base line.

## What is AI, ML and Data Science? How are they related?
Lets start be defining what each term means.  
### Artificial Intelligence:  
> AI is a very broad term and is the  super set of ML. In simple terms AI is a computer program that tries to mimic, develope and demonstrate  human behaviour. It can be as simple as a software playing chess or an autonomous car.  
### Machine Learning:
> Machine learning is one of the hottest topic right now. It refers to a computer ability to learn from sets of data and build up solution to  a given problem without human intervention.
ML is broadly classified into tow types
1. __*Supervised Learning:*__ One which uses labelled data to map imput to output. Example include  Decison trees, Linear Regression etc. (Dont worry we will cover these later)  
2. __*Unsupervised Learning:*__ One which doesnt require labelled or classified raining data but instead uses unlabeled data to peform a desired task. Popular example of Unsupervised learning are the Clustering algorithms.  
*Deep learning is a type of Supervised Machine learnign algorithm and is probably the most popular form of Machine Learning right now*  
### Data Science:
> Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that requires skills and concepts used in disciplines such as statistics, machine learning, visualization, etc. One could say a data scientist is just a fancy term for the business analyst. 
So finally we can sumarrise the  above using the following venn-digram.
